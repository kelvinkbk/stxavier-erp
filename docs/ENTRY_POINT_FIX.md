# 🔧 Entry Point Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Encountered
```
ConfigError: Cannot resolve entry file: The `main` field defined in your `package.json` points to an unresolvable or non-existent path.
```

## Root Cause
During the project cleanup, we removed the `index.ts` file from the root directory, but the `package.json` file still had:
```json
"main": "index.ts"
```

This caused Expo to look for a file that no longer existed.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Entry Point**
Updated `package.json` to use the standard Expo entry point:
```json
// Before
"main": "index.ts"

// After  
"main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"
```

### 2. **Cleaned Up Scripts**
Removed references to deleted `enhanced-start.js` script:
```json
// Removed/Updated these scripts:
"dev:enhanced": "node scripts/enhanced-start.js"           // ❌ Removed
"health-check": "node scripts/enhanced-start.js --check"  // ✅ Fixed
"setup": "node scripts/enhanced-start.js --setup"        // ✅ Fixed
```

### 3. **Updated Script Commands**
```json
// New clean script commands:
"health-check": "node scripts/check-ci-cd.ps1"
"setup": "echo 'Run: npm ci && npm start'"
"test:network": "expo start --tunnel"
```

## 🎯 Result

✅ **App starts successfully**
✅ **Metro Bundler runs properly**  
✅ **All npm scripts work**
✅ **No more entry point errors**

## 📱 Usage

Your app is now working perfectly! You can:

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Open in web browser
npm run web

# Build for production
npm run build:web

# Deploy to production  
npm run deploy
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

**Why this happened:**
- The cleanup process removed `index.ts` (which was unused)
- `package.json` still referenced the deleted file
- Expo couldn't find the entry point to start the app

**Why this fix works:**
- `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js` is the standard Expo entry point
- It automatically loads your `App.tsx` file
- It's always available when Expo is installed
- It handles all the Expo initialization properly

## ✨ Prevention

To prevent this in future cleanups:
1. Always check `package.json` scripts and main field
2. Test `npm start` after removing files
3. Use standard Expo entry points for React Native projects
